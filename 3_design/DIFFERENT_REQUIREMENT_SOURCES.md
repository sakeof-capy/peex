CALLS WITH FR

“I understand that requirements rarely come in a perfect form. They often come from multiple sources—such as business analysts, product owners, clients, user feedback, and technical constraints—and they can sometimes be incomplete, inconsistent, or even contradictory.”

“My first step is always to clarify and analyze these requirements. I look for contradictions, missing information, or vague language. I ask questions, propose scenarios, and validate assumptions to uncover hidden dependencies.”

“I use various techniques—like user stories, acceptance criteria, prototypes, and process diagrams—to make sense of what’s needed. I often schedule quick meetings or async discussions with stakeholders to confirm my understanding, especially when different sources say different things.”

“I believe communication is key. I don't just passively accept requirements—I actively engage with stakeholders to refine them. My goal is to ensure that what we build not only matches the business goals but is also technically feasible and user-friendly.”
