“When working on a feature or system, I understand that raw requirements often come from different sources—product owners, clients, business analysts, user feedback, or existing systems. These requirements can be incomplete, inconsistent, or even contradictory at first.”

“I don’t just implement what’s handed to me. I ask clarifying questions, identify contradictions or edge cases, and work closely with stakeholders to refine the requirements. I also cross-check multiple sources—such as specs, mockups, user stories, and business rules—to build a complete and clear picture.”

“In practice, I use tools like user stories, acceptance criteria, or flow diagrams to make sense of complex requirements. I also document assumptions or open questions and validate them with the team. This helps prevent costly mistakes and rework later.”

“Ultimately, I see myself not just as a coder, but as someone who helps transform vague or partial requirements into a solution that actually solves the problem and aligns with business goals.”
