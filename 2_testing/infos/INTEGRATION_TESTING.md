🔁 Integration Testing Strategies Explained
🧨 Big Bang Integration

What it is: You integrate all components at once, then test the entire system as a whole.

Pros:
- Simple to execute (just plug everything together).
- Can be fast for small systems or MVPs.

Cons:
- If a test fails, it's hard to tell which component caused it.
- Delays bug discovery until everything is built.

Example: Waiting until all services (auth, payments, DB, frontend) are ready, then doing full-system tests.

📐 Incremental Integration

Instead of waiting for the whole system, you test it piece by piece as modules become available.
⬆️ Top-Down

What it is: Start by testing high-level modules first, replacing lower-level components with stubs or mocks.

Pros:
- Early validation of user flows / APIs.
- Good when upper layers (e.g., UI, API endpoints) are ready first.

Cons:
- Lower-level modules might be poorly tested until later.

Example: Testing a web API by mocking out the database or services it depends on.

⬇️ Bottom-Up

What it is: Start with low-level components (e.g., DB layer, utility functions), using drivers to simulate higher-level calls.

Pros:
- Ensures foundational pieces are rock-solid.
- Helpful when utilities and backend logic are ready first.

Cons:
- UI or user flows can’t be tested early.

Example: Testing database access with real queries before the API layer is implemented.

🥪 Sandwich (Hybrid)

What it is: Combine top-down and bottom-up strategies.
Why: Sometimes parts of the system are ready in the middle (e.g., business logic), but not at the top (UI) or bottom (DB).

Pros:
- Flexible — allows testing available pieces early.

Cons:
- More complex to coordinate.

Example: Testing business logic with real utility modules below, and mocked APIs above.

✅ Summary Table
Strategy	Start Point	Uses Mocks/Stubs	Good When...
Big Bang	All modules	❌	You want fast MVP checks, small systems.
Top-Down	High-level	✅ for low-level	UI/API layer is ready, backends aren't.
Bottom-Up	Low-level	✅ for high-level	Foundational logic is ready.
Sandwich	Middle layer	✅ both directions	Middle modules are stable, rest vary.
