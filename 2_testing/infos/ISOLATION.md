In unit and integration testing, isolation is critical to ensure tests are deterministic, fast, and focused. I isolate the System Under Test (SUT) from external dependencies like databases, APIs, file systems, or unimplemented modules to prevent side effects and flakiness. This is especially useful when the real dependencies are slow, stateful, or unavailable during test execution.
