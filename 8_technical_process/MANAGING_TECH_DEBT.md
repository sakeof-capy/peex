Technical debt is a metaphor in software development that describes the extra work that builds up when quick, easy, or less-than-ideal solutions are used instead of the best, clean, and well-designed code.

How to answer:

1. Acknowledge technical debt as normal:
Explain that technical debt is inevitable in software development due to deadlines, changing requirements, or unfamiliar technologies.

2. Importance of prioritization:
Since not all technical debt has the same impact, itâ€™s important to prioritize which debts to fix first based on their risk to the system, impact on user experience, or potential to slow down future development.

3. Communication with stakeholders:
Managing technical debt requires clear communication with stakeholders to align on priorities, explain trade-offs, and ensure everyone understands why some debts are addressed now and others later.

4. Integration with existing work:
Sometimes technical debt can be fixed as part of other feature development to avoid duplication of effort and reduce overhead.

5. Avoiding new debt:
Ensure developers have the experience and awareness to fix debt correctly without introducing new issues, maintaining code quality.
