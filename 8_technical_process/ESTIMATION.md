1. Expert Judgment

This technique involves consulting people who have significant experience with similar projects or tasks. These experts use their knowledge and intuition to provide an estimate.
When to use: When you have access to experienced team members or stakeholders familiar with the work.
Pros: Quick and often reliable when experts are skilled.
Cons: Subjective and depends heavily on expert availability and accuracy.

2. Analogous Estimating

Also called “top-down estimating,” this method uses data from previous similar projects or tasks to predict the effort required for the current one.
When to use: When there is historical data available and the current task is similar to past ones.
Pros: Fast and less resource-intensive.
Cons: Less accurate if the current project has significant differences.

3. Bottom-Up Estimating

Break down a large task into smaller, more manageable components. Estimate the time or effort required for each smaller part, then sum these estimates to get the total.
When to use: When detailed requirements are available and tasks can be decomposed.
Pros: More accurate and detailed.
Cons: Time-consuming and requires a good understanding of all components.

4. Three-Point Estimating

This technique asks for three different estimates:

    Optimistic (O): Best-case scenario, assuming everything goes smoothly.

    Pessimistic (P): Worst-case scenario, assuming many problems.

    Most Likely (M): The most realistic or expected estimate.
    A weighted average is often calculated using the formula:
    Estimate = (O + 4M + P) / 6
    When to use: When there is uncertainty and variability in the task duration.
    Pros: Accounts for uncertainty and risk.
    Cons: Requires careful thought to provide realistic estimates.

5. Planning Poker / Story Points

A consensus-based technique used mainly in Agile teams. Team members discuss the task and assign it a relative effort score called a story point, usually based on complexity, risk, and size rather than time. Cards with point values are revealed simultaneously to avoid influence.
When to use: For Agile projects to estimate user stories or features.
Pros: Encourages team discussion and shared understanding; relative estimates simplify planning.
Cons: Story points can be subjective and may require calibration.

6. Delphi Technique

A structured communication method where experts provide estimates anonymously. After rounds of estimation and feedback, the group converges on a consensus estimate without peer pressure.
When to use: When you want unbiased, collective expert estimates and to avoid dominant personalities influencing results.
Pros: Reduces bias, encourages honest estimates.
Cons: Can be time-consuming due to multiple rounds.

7. Parametric Estimating

Uses mathematical models to estimate effort based on parameters such as lines of code, number of transactions, or function points. For example, if you know how long it takes to develop one function point, multiply that by the total function points in the task.
When to use: When you have reliable data and measurable parameters.
Pros: Can be very accurate if model parameters are correct.
Cons: Requires historical data and understanding of the model.
