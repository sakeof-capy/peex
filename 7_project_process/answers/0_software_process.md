Applying software processes to improve product quality and workflow means using structured methods and team-specific practices to ensure consistency, maintainability, and reliability in our work.

There are several types of software development processes Iâ€™ve worked with, and each helps improve product quality in different ways:
1. Agile / Scrum

In Scrum-based environments, we follow iterative development cycles (sprints), use user stories for requirement tracking, and hold regular standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

How I apply it:
- I break down features into small tasks and prioritize based on business value.
- During retrospectives, I help identify workflow bottlenecks or quality issues and suggest improvements.
- I actively contribute to grooming sessions to refine requirements and align them with feasibility and internal standards.

2. Code Quality Processes

This includes internal coding standards, static analysis, peer reviews, and automated tests.

How I apply it:
- I follow internal code style guides that may extend or override community recommendations (e.g., using a project-specific naming convention, file structure, or linter rules).
- I participate in and lead code reviews to ensure logic, readability, and security align with internal best practices.
- I use pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines to enforce formatting, test coverage, and linting before merging any code.

3. Continuous Integration / Delivery (CI/CD)

These processes automate builds, tests, and deployments to catch issues early and speed up delivery.

How I apply it:
- I configure CI pipelines to include automated unit and integration tests.
- I use CI feedback to fix issues before code hits production or QA.
- I follow internal branching models (Git Flow (with main, develop, improv, fix branches)) for consistency.

ðŸ’¬ Summary

In my view, software process is not just about following Agile ceremonies or writing testsâ€”it's about applying consistent, team-aligned methods to every aspect of development, from coding to documentation. These processes help build a quality culture, make onboarding easier, reduce bugs, and improve team efficiency over time."
